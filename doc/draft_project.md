### 1. Introduction of the web application

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_sport"> Fantasy sport games </a> are those in which you compose a team with real players from different teams and earn points based on their performance each week, winning the one that accumulates the most points at the end of the season, it is intended to be very similar to the real formula one championship. The first thing to know is that **Formula Fantasy** will consist of composing a team made up of five drivers and two teams.

### 2. Purpose of the web application

The application arises as many of the other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_sport"> fantasy sport games </a> that have emerged recently taking advantage of the pull of the start of the championship, but unlike these, we intend to propose an alternative that will become the market reference, make up for the shortcomings of other platforms, and is at the height of a leading competition such as Formula 1.

The application will have a main game mode in which the user, at the latest 1h before the first free practice, will design his team formed by 5 drivers, and 2 teams, the result of the classification and the race will determine the amount of points that each driver will have obtained respectively, as well as the positions of the respective single-seaters of the chosen teams.

In each Grand Prix, the user will be able to choose between the 3 teams he has specified to compete in that Grand Prix. And as the championship progresses, the sum of points obtained will be reflected in different rankings at national, regional level, or in leagues formed by between 2 and 20 competitors chosen by the user or users (family, friends, colleagues, etc.), and these points will also be transformed into virtual money within the application to sign better drivers or teams.

The idea is that the user only has to worry about enjoying playing each Grand Prix and thus encourage the passion for Formula 1. From this concept will emerge different levers that will make the player win more in each race (use of proper DRS, fast lap, number of overtakes, pit times).

As an annex, it is intended to implement a betting system in which users not only enjoy feeling like real Formula 1 team managers, but also test all their knowledge and predictions in each race.
